			<li>Updated default tab and security preferences</li>

		<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

		</ul>
		<h3>Release Notes</h3>
		<p>
			Due to the long gap between the time RetroZilla was last worked on and now,
			We decided to release one last minor update before the work on Gecko begins.
			The new address bar search keywords may not work unless you have a new profile 
			created after the release of RetroZilla 2.1. We also added an update notifier 
			on the RetroZilla home page (about:home) to notify users that don't follow the 
			MSFN threads that a new version is out.

		<h2>RetroZilla 2.0</h2>
		<h3>New Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>New Home Page: about:home.</li>
			<li>about:changelog.</li>
			<li>Session Manager and Crash Restore system</li>
			<li>Updated internal URLs to reflect new website</li>
			<li>Added Get Extensions link to Tools menu and Contribute link to Help menu</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>More &quot;M&quot; logos replaced.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Release Notes</h3>
		<p>
			This should be our last major features-only and rebrand release. Starting with 3.0, we will upgrade
			the Gecko core to be more compliant for the modern web. We would like to thank the developers of the
			Crash Recovery and Session Manager extensions for a platform to build on for our new Session Restore
			feature. Users who already have any these extensions installed are advised to remove them.

		</ul>
		<h3>Release Notes</h3>
		<p>
			Our plan for the future is to ship UX-enhancing features in 2.0, and then start backporting CSS changes in
			3.0, so the RetroZilla version numbers will match the Firefox version number that has CSS parity with RetroZilla.
